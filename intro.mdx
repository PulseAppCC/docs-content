A lightweight service monitoring solution for tracking the availability of whatever service your heart desires!

## Getting Started
Let's get you up and runningâ€”this will only take a few minutes! Start by [creating your account](#creating-your-account) and
making your first status page. You can do this on our cloud or on your [own instance](/self-hosting). Once done, you can add
your services and start monitoring them. See [Next Steps](#next-steps) for more.

### Creating your Account
- First, head to our [Dashboard](https://pulseapp.cc/dashboard) and fill out the form. ![Registering](https://cdn.rainnny.club/auhNOjrcYz6u.png)
